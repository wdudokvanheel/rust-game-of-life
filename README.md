## Conway's Game of Life in Rust.

### Running the simulator

The only requirement is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and a videocard that supports OpenGL.

To run the simulator run the command
`
cargo run
`

### Keyboard commands

* **Spacebar**: Pause/resume the simulation
* **1-5**: Set simulation speed
* **R**: Reset the simulation with a random pattern
* **C**: Reset the simulation and clear the board


### TODO

- [x] Add grid
- [x] Spacebar to start (and toggle running)
- [x] R to reset / C to clear
- [x] Center new patterns
- [x] Wrap around board
- [ ] Click to add life when paused
